    <h2>Tommaso, 19 years old 🐈 </h2>
    <p> 🧑‍💻 I'm a young enthusiast in the world of computer science, and I'm particularly passionate about Frontend development and Designing website interfaces. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and programming languages.</p>

    
## Projects :computer:

Users can explore the menu and conveniently reserve a table directly from the website for a seamless dining experience. Built with <a href="https://github.com/peppinotechtrends" target="_blank">@PeppinoTechTrends</a>

The key components include a Java client for desktop screen capture, a Python web server (Flask) for receiving screen data, and Apache Kafka for facilitating communication between the client and server.
